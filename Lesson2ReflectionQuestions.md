Lesson 2 Reflection Questions:





What accessibility enhancements were the most challenging to implement, and why? 

\-**Aria, because if you can use an HTML element or attribute with the semantics and behavior you require already built in, instead of repurposing an element and adding an Aria role, state, or property to make it accessible, then do so.** 

How do ARIA attributes improve the experience for users relying on assistive technologies? 

\-**It provides a way to make web applications and dynamic content more accessible to assistive technologies such as screen readers and voice recognition software**

What tools did you use to check color contrast, and how did they help? 

**-I used WebAIM.org as a contrast checker and it helped to identify the contrast ratios for foreground and backgrounds**
